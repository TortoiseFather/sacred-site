**Purpose.** Transform [D0](ref:d0) into *verifiable requirements* using **MoSCoW**, yielding **[D2](ref:d2)**.

**Example E2, a MoSCoW structure on a given UK main line route.** 
### Must (illustrative)
- Detect large, static objects in the track corridor; infer corridor via track extraction.
- Enumerate environmental risks to seed Step 2 hazard identification.
- Operate over a representative subset of the S-Bahn Berlin typical service.
- Be realisable within the tech envelope evidenced in **[A](ref:a)**.
- Achieve performance comparable to human drivers for scoped tasks.

### Should
- Detect moving objects materially affecting risk.
- Keep Scenario Definition and ODM consistent re *known-knowns/known-unknowns* to enable Criticality Determination (Step 4).
- Operate in typical non-disastrous adverse conditions, day or night.
- Be representable in simulation for Step 6 evaluation.

### Could
- Expand to network-wide and extreme conditions with sufficient data and validation.
- Discover hazards not initially catalogued in Steps 2/3 via observation/analytics.

### Would
- Employ track-side sensing only where onboard sensing is infeasible for the scoped scenario.
