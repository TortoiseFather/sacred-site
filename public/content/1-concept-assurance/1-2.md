**Purpose.** Transform [D0](ref:d0) into *verifiable requirements* using **MoSCoW**, yielding **[D2](ref:d2)**.

To support the development of an actionable ODM, we must scope out the Autonomous Capabilities of our system, it is often the case that Autonomous Capabilities are given as a requirement which is part of [D0](ref:d0), however, in the event that this is not the case, we instead must scope our vague definition into a series of actionable requirements, that which is needed and Must be accomplished, that which ideally, using the state of the art, Should be attainable, that which Could be attainable under the current SotA/budget and finally, that which is out of scope so Won't be attainable. We represent this as a MoSCoW structure [3](cite:3).

**Example E2, a MoSCoW structure on a given UK main line route.** 
For our examples we are assessing a version of the Newcastle main line which has autonomy to the level of GoA-4. Being as the system does not exist, this MoSCoW structure presents our expectations of whatever the system is, going forward in order to properly scope the rest of our work.
### Must (illustrative)
- Detect large, static objects in the track corridor; infer corridor via track extraction.
- Enumerate environmental risks to seed Step 2 hazard identification.
- Operate over a representative subset of the S-Bahn Berlin typical service.
- Be realisable within the tech envelope evidenced in **[A](ref:a)**.
- Achieve performance comparable to human drivers for scoped tasks.

### Should
- Detect moving objects materially affecting risk.
- Keep Scenario Definition and ODM consistent re *known-knowns/known-unknowns* to enable Criticality Determination (Step 4).
- Operate in typical non-disastrous adverse conditions, day or night.
- Be representable in simulation for Step 6 evaluation.

### Could
- Expand to network-wide and extreme conditions with sufficient data and validation.
- Discover hazards not initially catalogued in Steps 2/3 via observation/analytics.

### Won't
– Relay information to trackside operators.
– Be expected to operate beyond the defined route segment without reassessment.
– Replace signalling infrastructure entirely—signal interpretation is assumed, not signal elimination.
– Handle highly ambiguous safety events (e.g., trespasser with unclear intent) with guaranteed success.
