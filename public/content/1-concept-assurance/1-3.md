(To do, change all of this. Right now this is talking about the state machine, but the state machine is the final iteration of the ODM, first ODM is Operating Area serparation into signals, then the signals are seperated by milestones, then each milestone is represented through states.)
**Purpose.** Draft a *top-level Operational Domain Model (ODM)* as a **state machine** describing the journey lifecycle.

**Method**
- Identify **states** (e.g., *Idle → Pre-Departure → Departure → Cruise → Approach → Station_Arrival → Passenger_Alighting → Passenger_Boarding → Station_Departure → …*).
- Define **milestones** that trigger transitions (signal cleared, platform edge detected, speed profile change, door interlock closed).
- For each state, note entry/exit conditions and safety-critical variables (signal visibility, speed, train integrity) and monitoring responsibilities.
- Align with scenarios in **[D1](ref:d1)** and boundary conditions from **[C](ref:c)**.

**Output.** A reviewable narrative + schematic that stakeholders validate before Step 2 hazards.

**Example E2** is an example of a top-level ODM produced in Step 1.3.

The signal-level diagram abstracts the operated area into contiguous signal sections from Swalwell Junction → MetroCentre → (underpass) → Newcastle. The ODM represents the world as understood by the system [[8]](cite:8). Within [step 1](/#/steps/1-concept-assurance), we understand the system to the depth required by [D3](ref:d3) with the depth provided by the Area of Operation. To that end, our Top-Level Domain Model is abstracted as a series of signals and inter-signal sections, each serving as a potential decision boundary or milestone [[7]](cite:7). At this stage, the diagram deliberately omits dynamic factors or complexities which will be introduced by Ecosystem dynamics, for the purposes of fulfilling Step 1's goal of Concept Assurance.

For demonstration, we focus on the first section, between Swalwell Junction and the initial signal west of the A1114 underpass.

*Figure 1, high level overview of Swalwell Signal 1, for more detail, see a PhD about Trains.*

A high level look at the area reveals that the section begins at the junction adjacent to the River Derwent and proceeds eastwards beneath an overpass before reaching Signal 1. The alignment is enclosed by fencing and dense vegetation, and the track curvature at the junction increases derailment risk at high approach speeds [[5]](cite:5). As a precautionary measure, Network Rail imposes an approach limit of approximately 40 km h, consistent with typical main-line geometry constraints [[14]](cite:14) [[20]](cite:20). The area also includes a road overpass, which introduces external dependencies: structural integrity [[6]](cite:6), potential intrusion and environmental occlusion. Each of these will later become eco-centric hazards under Step 2.

In Step 1, the ODM captures only measurable contextual attributes of the route section, before hazard causation or responsibility is assigned. For Swalwell → Signal 1, the initial model records:

Operating time and duration: both daylight and night-time operation; typical section traversal within seconds, or a few minutes under station-holding conditions.

- *Restrictions*: permanent speed limit ≈ 40 km h; no stopping under the overpass except in a managed minimum-risk state; continuous lineside signalling and driver–signaller (AWS/TPWS) channels expected.

- *Environmental phenomena*: rainfall, fog, snow, wind; seasonal low-adhesion conditions (leaves, ice); lighting transitions and transient sun-glare.

- *Static objects*: track and junction geometry (curves, turnouts), the overpass structure, fencing (manufactured + vegetation), and Signal 1 as a fixed operational control.

- *Dynamic objects*: opposing or preceding trains, road traffic on the overpass, pedestrians adjacent to fencing, maintenance crews, debris sources, and occasional wildlife.

**Note, this taxonomy was inspired by the Taxonomy for Rail proposed by Faunhofer IKS in [[1]](cite:1)**

This step is complemented by a MoSCoW requirements breakdown:

- **Must** safely operate a passenger service between Swalwell and MetroCentre, obeying signals and speed limits while maintaining AWS/TPWS communication.

- **Should** match human driver reliability under normal and minor-disruption conditions.

- **Could** optimise for energy and comfort through driving-profile control.

- **Won't** integrate digital-twin.
