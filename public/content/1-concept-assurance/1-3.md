(To do, change all of this. Right now this is talking about the state machine, but the state machine is the final iteration of the ODM, first ODM is Operating Area serparation into signals, then the signals are seperated by milestones, then each milestone is represented through states.)
**Purpose.** Draft a *top-level Operational Domain Model (ODM)* as a **state machine** describing the journey lifecycle.

**Method**
- Identify **states** (e.g., *Idle → Pre-Departure → Departure → Cruise → Approach → Station_Arrival → Passenger_Alighting → Passenger_Boarding → Station_Departure → …*).
- Define **milestones** that trigger transitions (signal cleared, platform edge detected, speed profile change, door interlock closed). See **[E2](ref:e2)** for illustration.
- For each state, note entry/exit conditions and safety-critical variables (signal visibility, speed, train integrity) and monitoring responsibilities.
- Align with scenarios in **[D1](ref:d1)** and boundary conditions from **[C](ref:c)**.

**Output.** A reviewable narrative + schematic (e.g., **[E2](ref:e2)**) that stakeholders validate before Step 2 hazards.
