The Context of Safe Operation (CSO), not to be confused with the Safe Operating Contest [(SOC)](/#/steps/1-concept-assurance/examples/1.2-e) is a metric extrapolated from the [Operational Design Model (ODM)](/#/steps/1-concept-assurance/examples/1-e).

While not directly relevant to SACRED itself, the CSO is important when considering the wider implementation of a system assured by an ODM.
