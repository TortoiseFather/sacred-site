**Purpose.** Establish whether the concept in [D0](ref:d0) is feasible *for this route and context*, and surface constraints/assumptions that will shape requirements and later **Step 6 (AS Design Assurance)**.

**Activities**
- Survey peer systems (metros, mainline pilots), standards (CBTC, ETCS, IEC/EN), supplier capabilities, and operator experience.
- Extract *capabilities & limits* relevant to your environment: signalling type, comms coverage, platform geometry, adhesion/low-adhesion handling, sensing ranges/occlusions, fail-safe behaviours.
- Map findings to scenarios in [D1](ref:d1) (e.g., tunnels, weather regime, peak loads).
- Record a concise **Artefact [A] SotA** (see [A](ref:a)): what exists, what’s proven, and what’s merely plausible.

**Evidence example (E1).** Paris Métro Line 1 (GoA-4) demonstrates driverless operation feasibility in segregated infrastructure. **Implication:** comparable autonomy on open mainline will need additional mitigations (trespass, weather variability, complex interlockings).
