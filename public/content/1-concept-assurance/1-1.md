**Purpose.** Establish whether the concept in [D0](ref:d0) is feasible *for this route and context*, and surface constraints/assumptions that will shape requirements and later **Step 6 (AS Design Assurance)**.

**Activities**
- Survey peer systems (metros, mainline pilots), standards (CBTC, ETCS, IEC/EN), supplier capabilities, and operator experience.
- Extract *capabilities & limits* relevant to your environment: signalling type, comms coverage, platform geometry, adhesion/low-adhesion handling, sensing ranges/occlusions, fail-safe behaviours.
- Map findings to scenarios in [D1](ref:d1) (e.g., tunnels, weather regime, peak loads).
- Record a concise **Artefact [A] SotA** (see [A](ref:a)): what exists, what’s proven, and what’s merely plausible.

**Justification**
The current State of the Art in railway automation reflects a fragmented progression, where advances in driverless metros contrast sharply with the slower evolution of mainline autonomy. While Grade of Automation 4 (GoA-4) systems operate successfully in closed environments such as the Copenhagen Metro, their success depends on tightly controlled infrastructure, segregated tracks, and deterministic signalling. Translating these capabilities to open mainline operation has proved far more complex. Unlike metros, mainline networks must contend with variable adhesion, shared infrastructure, mixed traffic, and human-in-the-loop interactions that limit the applicability of fully deterministic control. To this end, determining the exact scope of your system as well as any contemporaries is essential for the purposes of ODM creation.

**Evidence example (E1).** Paris Métro Line 1 (GoA-4) demonstrates driverless operation feasibility in segregated infrastructure. **Implication:** comparable autonomy on open mainline will need additional mitigations (trespass, weather variability, complex interlockings).
