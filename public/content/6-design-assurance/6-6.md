Here is a decision point in which we determine if the state of the art can fully encapsulate all of our requirements to the degree that they can handle everything within [D16.](ref:d16)

Within step 5, we took a high level look at what classifies as a minimum risk state, within 5.2, we argued that if the technology is good enough, we can autonomously determine a fallback method. If the SotA is not to a degree that we can properly determine the boundaries for autonomous limitations, we revert back to [step 5](#/steps/5-safety-actualisation) and re-do the Minimum Risk State with the SotA in mind.

If we have identified that the SotA can fully encapsulate the Hazardous Failure Arguments, proceed to [Step 7.](#/steps/7-soc)
