A Hazard and Operability Syudy (HAZOP) is a systematic, structured method for identifying and analysing potential hazards and operational issues within a system, process, or environment. The purpose of a HAZOP is to find deviations from design intent that could lead to unsafe or inefficient operation.

The process of a HAZOP is to look at a potential failure point (i.e the junction) then apply a Guide Word to it, i.e "More" in the context of "Speed", then provide additional context in the form of a Deviation, or a cause for why that guide word may have occured. For example "onboard system failure resulting in increased speed."

From here, we assess the likelihood of this event happening, the consequence and if needed, a recommendation. To finish our example, the criticality would be severe, as increased speed on a junction is a derailment risk, however, the likelihood of this happening is incredibly rare, 1/1,000 years rare, so overall the hazard is yello, or, fine as long as the risk is reduced to the level that is as low as reasonably practicable. 

In effect, the recommendation would be, within step 6, find some sort of fallback mechanism so that if a hardware failure was to occur on a junction, then the speed would not increase.

Do this multiple times over every failure point and proceed to [Step 5](/#/steps/5-safety-actualisation/) to discuss what happens in the event of a failure.
