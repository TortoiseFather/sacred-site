While Step 4.2 defines system-specific metrics that describe how the autonomous system behaves, Step 4.3 introduces the complementary layer of environmental metrics.

These metrics describe the minimum operational scope of the environment itself, translating the qualitative description of the route into quantifiable environmental boundaries that directly constrain the system’s behaviour.

**Method**

- Extract Environmental Descitors from the ODM

Begin with the descriptive elements of the environment already identified during Step 1/2. These include geography, topology, infrastructure, and environmental phenomena.

- Translate Descriptors into Quantifiable Metrics

Each qualitative descriptor is converted into a measurable parameter. For example, rather than 'There is a bridge which limits visibility and then a signal shortly after' quantify it as 'Signal >200 meters past bridge.'

**Example**

From [D9](ref:d9) we classify one failure as a Signal Passed At Red (SPAR). In operation, a SPAR occurs when a signal is not properly reacted to in time and the train passes without reaction. Or, phrased seperately, a SPAR occurs when the speed approaching the signal is so large that the driver cannot react in time.

UK Signalling Standards require that any system must acknowledge a signal between 4 and 8 seconds of passing it, typical operating range of a standard UK mainline system is between 0-125mph, or a maximum of 56m/s. Within our specific scenario, the speed limit is 40km/h, or 11.1m/s. At this speed limit, depending on track conditions, the signal must be seen between 44.4-88.8m before passing. 

Given the conditions of the track, our adhesion will vary, within icy conditions, we will require more time to react, within normal conditions, we can afford to be more lenient. We can classify our position on this range as a Signal Visibility Budget, or SVB. In particularly harsh weather, SVB>=2, in less extreme situations, SVB>=4

We can determine if our route is safe by converting the speed of the train to m/s and determining the time between the signal becoming visible and the train passing it, we represent the time as T, then comparing our T to SVB.
