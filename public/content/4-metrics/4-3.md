While Step 4.2 defines system-specific metrics that describe how the autonomous system behaves, Step 4.3 introduces the complementary layer of environmental metrics.

These metrics describe the minimum operational scope of the environment itself, translating the qualitative description of the route into quantifiable environmental boundaries that directly constrain the system’s behaviour.

**Method**

- Extract Environmental Descitors from the ODM

Begin with the descriptive elements of the environment already identified during Step 1/2. These include geography, topology, infrastructure, and environmental phenomena.

- Translate Descriptors into Quantifiable Metrics

Each qualitative descriptor is converted into a measurable parameter. For example, rather than 'There is a bridge which limits visibility and then a signal shortly after' quantify it as 'Signal >200 meters past bridge.'

**Example, the Signal Viability Budget**

The Signal Visibility Budget (SVB) defines the minimum amount of time or distance for which a signal must be visible to guarantee that a train can perceive the signal, initiate braking, and come to a safe stop under the prevailing conditions.

From [D9](ref:d9) we classify one failure as a Signal Passed At Red (SPAR). In operation, a SPAR occurs when the approach speed and prevailing conditions leave insufficient time or distance for the system to react and brake safely. Or, phrased seperately, a SPAR occurs when the speed approaching the signal is so large that the driver cannot react in time.

SVB is therefore not a fixed value. It varies with speed and environmental context. Higher approach speeds reduce the available budget, while degraded adhesion increases the budget required to stop safely. UK signalling standards assume that a signal must be perceived and reacted to with an effective reaction window of approximately 4–8 seconds under normal operating conditions. At higher line speeds this translates into proportionally higher required sighting distances. SVB therefore functions as an operational metric: for a given speed and adhesion state, it directly determines the minimum required viewing distance.

In practice, SVB is evaluated in the time, with distance derived from current speed. For example, 40mph translates to 17.9m/s, so an SVB of 4 requires a viewing distance of 71.6m

In this work, SVB is treated as an environmental context-dependent safety margin. Under good adhesion conditions, the system may operate with a lower SVB requirement; under poor or icy conditions, the required SVB increases to reflect longer braking distances and reduced controllability.

We can determine if our route is safe by converting the speed of the train to m/s and determining the time T between the signal becoming visible and the train passing it, then verifying T>SVB.
