Finally, requirement assurance is the process of taking the requirements scoped within 3.3, as they are within the ODM and ensuring that they are actually possible. Limit testing each requirement to find where it is not possible, in effect laying the groundwork for the SOC.

For example, consider 3 in [D9](ref:d9). In the event of Low Adhesion, we are to report for Railhead Treatment Trains, these are trains which run down the line and blast the track with high pressure water-jetting, however, as we designate 3 as a Ego-leaning concern, there is a possiblilty that the buildup is so severe and goes under-reported such that the reporting of the issue is a non-solution. This is of course, considered a failurestate as demonstrated within our [Milestone example](/#/steps/4-metrics/examples/4-e) where **detection of low wheel adhesion** would be a cause for an emergency break.

The determination of what 'low wheel adhesion' means as part of [D10](ref:d10) depends on the specific system and will be discussed further within [Step 6](/#/steps/6-design-assurance) however, for this moment in time, the standard maximum as reported by [the seasonal intelligence platform.](cite:38) 

TODO I'm not happy with this.
