The limitation report is a report detailing the possible limitations of the system which could lead to a hazard, the historical situations involving each hazard and the mitigation strategies used.

Once the report has been generated, ensure that all requirements listed within [D9](ref:d9), hazards listed within [D5](ref:d5) and limitations have been accounted for within the ODM [D7](ref:d7), if they have, continue to Step 4, if not, revert to Step 2.
