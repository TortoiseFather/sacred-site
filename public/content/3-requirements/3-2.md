**Justification**

Once hazards have been validated in Step 3.1, the next stage of SACRED is to interrogate how those hazards are currently mitigated, through infrastructure, procedure or technology, then to determine whether those mitigations remain sufficient within the operational scope defined by the ODM.

**Process**

The Mitigation Review proceeds as a structured audit of each validated hazard, following a pattern of identify → evaluate → assign → record

- Identify

Collect all currently recognised defences, barriers, or recovery actions associated with the hazard. These may be drawn from standards, industry recommendations or route-specific practice.

- Evaluate

Examine whether the mitigation remains valid given the proposed automation concept. A mitigation may be technically sound for human drivers but ineffective for an AI-based controller (e.g., reliance on visual signal recognition in the event of no deterministic computer vision).

- Record risk

If mitigation effectiveness cannot be demonstrated or verified through measurable performance, the residual risk is logged for later quantification in Step 4 or for inclusion in the Limitation Report [D10](ref:d10).
