**Justification**

Hazard Validation is the process of taking the analytical outputs of step 2, [D5](ref:d5) and [D1](ref:d1) and bringing them up to standard with the verifiable requirements that will define the systemâ€™s safe operational scope. Up to this point, hazards have been identified, decomposed, and classified as either eco- or *ego-*relevant; however, they remain theoretical.

Step 3.1 justifies the continued inclusion or exclusion of each hazard by validating its existence, relevance, and controllability within the context of [D1](ref:d1).

**Process and example**

The process of Hazard Validation follows a logic of evidence through triangulation:

- Cross referencing

Is each component as identified by [D5] possible within [D1], for example, in [2.6](/#/steps/2-hazard-identification/examples/2-6) we identify 'vegitation blocking the signal' as a potential cause, in [D1] we mention 'the operation between Swalwell and Newcastle.' So, a physical exploration of the area revealed the image below, the track is surrounded by woodland which is maintained, therefore, vegitation can be classified as a validated hazard

- Verify plausibility

For some components identified within [D5], for example leaf adhesion, the evidence is not entirely clear, the previous image was taken in the middle of summer so there is no direct evidence of leaf buildup causing ahesion issues. To this end, we rely upon historical accounts to verify that yes, leaf adhesion has previously been an issue in simiar areas. Referring to [F](ref:f) for SotA history.
 
- Engage stakeholders and subject-matter experts

Every route is different, not every component can be verified from a tertiary assessment, not every issue has happened historically. To this end, some components must be verified theoretically by stakeholders. Typically this takes the form of interviews as seen within [G.](ref:g)

This process transforms the exploratory mapping of Step 2 into a verified foundation for requirement derivation. Once all hazards have been verified, log them in a central document, [D8](ref:d8)
