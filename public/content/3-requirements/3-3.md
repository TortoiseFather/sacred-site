Where Step 3.1 validated what hazards exist and Step 3.2 examined how they are mitigated, Step 3.3 focuses on what must be true for those mitigations to work and updates the Hazard Register with Assurance Traceability.

Safety goals and mitigations must not remain abstract; they must become measurable and enforceable within the ODM and every requirement must clearly trace back to its originating hazard and forward to its verification method, forming a complete assurance chain., in essense, this is updating [D8](ref:d8) with the information from 3.2.
