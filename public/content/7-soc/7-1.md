The first task of Step 7 is to translate [D7](ref:d7) so that it exists within the Minimum Risk State determined within [D16](ref:d16), within the limitations set through [D19](ref:d19). These boundaries define the limits in which the ego-vehicle can function safely without invoking deprecated fallback.

**Example**

Within [Step 4-4](/#/steps/4-metrics/examples/4-4) we introduced Signal Reaction Time (SRT) as an environmental metric and Viewing Distance (VD) as an operational metric. When VD is paired with speed to obtain m·s⁻¹, we can translate distance into time T and determine the Signal Viability Budget (SVB) as the relationship between SRT and T.

SRT, however, is not fixed. It is directly influenced by adhesion. On a particularly icy day we may see SRT = 8 s, because braking capability has collapsed. When adhesion is low, there is a risk that we break the constraints listed within [SACRED Example: D13 – Unified Metrics – Adhesion](ref:d13) particularly once μ < 0.046. When this happens, the system must request extended headroom, as defined by the degraded operations in Step 5.

SVB itself is determined jointly by SRT, braking capability, and train speed. If the visible distance ahead of the cab drops below the viability threshold, the system cannot guarantee safe interpretation of the scene before reaching the signal. Unlike geometric constraints, Viewing Distance is not constant. It varies dynamically due to environmental influences and sensor behaviour such as:

- Dense rain or fog

- Low sun / glare emerging from the overpass

- Night-time contrast collapse

- Lens contamination (salt spray, dust, debris)

- Partial hardware occlusion or obstruction

These effects were evaluated within Step 6, where CV-based detection experiments demonstrated that performance degrades significantly under visibility constraints, producing a minimum viable viewing distance (VVD) that the system can reliably achieve under non-ideal conditions.

From here, we can draw our boundaries. A low SVB corresponds to high adhesion and strong braking capability; a high SVB corresponds to degraded adhesion and extended stopping distances. These two factors therefore form a coupled boundary condition for the SOC.

If the measured adhesion falls below μ_min, the ego-vehicle can no longer guarantee the braking profile required to satisfy the stopping distance. Likewise, if viewing distance falls below the VVD threshold (e.g., the system cannot see the minimum required 54 m ahead), then VD < SVB and autonomous operation can no longer be assured. In both cases, fallback operations are required.
