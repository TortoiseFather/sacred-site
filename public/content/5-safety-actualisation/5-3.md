Within Step 4, we identified a series of metrics relevant to the hazards we verified previously, these metrics set bounds in which the hazards can be approached safely, however, this begs the question, what happens when we are unable to meet our metric targets?

From steps 5-1 and 5-2, we understand the triggers which cause failure and the minimum state we seek to return to from failure, from here, we must determine the immediate Response, how we can Assure this and determine the fallback Process. We call this process, the TRAP paradigm.

The TRAP paradigm is defined as:

- Trigger

    The condition that indicates a metric boundary has been breached

- Response

    Deciding the level of response, from local recovery to systemic intervention.

- Assure

    Defining the safe degraded mode of operation.

- Process

    The enactment of the fallback plan as a procedural routine.

TRAP shares ancestry with well-known decision cycles such as John Boyd’s OODA loop (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act) and SACE’s SUDA model (Sense–Understand–Decide–Act). 

Theoretically, we can predict a large amount of failure-states, since railway is a largely restrictive domain. If the [ODM](ref:d7) is comprehensive enough, then hazards should be properly accounted for, especially when considering the restricted operation possibilities inherent to rail; ultimately a train can only speed up or slow down.

The emphasis here is on proceduralisation. We do not assume that autonomy can improvise its way through degraded conditions; instead, we define a structured playbook in advance. This ensures that failure states are not treated as anomalies but as anticipated events with rehearsed responses.
