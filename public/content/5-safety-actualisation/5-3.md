Within Step 4, we identified a series of metrics relevant to the hazards we verified previously, these metrics set bounds in which the hazards can be approached safely, however, this begs the question, what happens when we are unable to meet our metric targets?

From steps 5-1 and 5-2, we understand the triggers which cause failure and the minimum state we seek to return to from failure, from here, we must determine the immediate Response, how we can Assure this and determine the fallback Process. We call this process, the TRAP paradigm.

The TRAP paradigm is defined as:

- Trigger

    The condition that indicates a metric boundary has been breached

- Response

    Deciding the level of response, from local recovery to systemic intervention.

- Assure

    Defining the safe degraded mode of operation.

- Process

    The enactment of the fallback plan as a procedural routine.

TRAP shares ancestry with well-known decision cycles such as John Boyd’s OODA loop (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act) and SACE’s SUDA model (Sense–Understand–Decide–Act). 

Theoretically, we can predict a large amount of failure-states, since railway is a largely restrictive domain. If the [ODM](ref:d7) is comprehensive enough, then hazards should be properly accounted for, especially when considering the restricted operation possibilities inherent to rail; ultimately a train can only speed up or slow down. Here, we create a fallback method, a context-dependent plan composed from:

- The current operational mode

- The contents of the ODM

- Live hazard conditions

- System capability (SotA)

- Ecosystem constraints

In traditional railway operation, degraded modes are prescriptive: instructions such as “apply emergency brake,” “await signaller permission,” or “run under manual mode” are proceduralised for humans. Autonomous rail systems collapse this assumption. The system must determine both what fallback to choose and how to execute it without exacerbating risk.

This is analogous to what Sadiq et al. describe as pockets of flexibility in workflow systems, where processes cannot be fully specified in advance, and are instead partly defined at runtime through “build activities” that compose a valid sub-process dynamically[63](cite:63). In autonomous rail, fallback behaviour operates the same way: the system defines a partial model (the MRS) and then instantiates an actual degraded procedure from available actions, according to constraints embedded within the ODM.

Autonomous planning is a field in of itself and the process of selecting deprecated modes of operation is not a simple feat, especially when considering deprecated operation as a response to an external failure. Put another way, the T and the R of the TRAP cycle is theoretically simpler than the A and P. Whether fallback selection can be performed autonomously depends entirely on the state of the art. If the system has sufficient sensing and classification capability to distinguish the relevant failure modes, then the fallback can be determined at runtime. If it does not, fallback selection must remain pre-assigned and the MRS must be revised accordingly. In that case, we revert to Step 5.2 and redefine the minimum risk state in line with what the technology can reliably support. Otherwise, continue to [Step 6.](/#/steps/6-design-assurance)
