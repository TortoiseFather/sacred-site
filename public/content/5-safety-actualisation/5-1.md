Step 5.1 is the classification of failure, specifying exactly what it means to fall outside of the acceptable mean.

Throughout step 4, metrics were identified based on the operational conditions of the system and an acceptable range was determined based on context, criticality and egoeco dynamics. To this end, anything that falls outside of the acceptable range is determined a failure, however, failure is also context dependent.

Within typical operation, a safe cruise speed could be classified as within 10\% of speed limit, with a drop below that speed classified as a hazard due to the knockon effects it ultimately has to the timetabling; however, being at a low speed within this context is not a failure in of itself. Consider the possibility that the system is resuming operation after a signalled emergency stop, from the rise from standstill to cruise operation the speed inherently must be below limit. Within this context, the 'failure trigger' is a dropping rate of speed, rather than the speed itsef.

From this, we can understand 5.1 to be the combination of [D7](ref:d7) and the context provided by [D10](ref:d10), to be applied to all metrics of Step 4 as captured by [D15](ref:d15).

**Method/Example**

Within [Step 4.4](/#/steps/4-metrics/examples/4-4) we identified that a signal needs to be seen a 4-8 seconds before the driver passes it, depending on braking adhesion. Within fair environments, it is reasonable for the minimum viewing distance to be 4 seconds, while environmnets with unstable adhesion requirements requires 8 seconds of viewing, we represent this within the following table:
