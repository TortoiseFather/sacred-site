A 'Minimum Risk State' (MRS) is the operational conditions of the cab wherein the maximum output is produced while avoiding the failure triggers determined within [5-1.](/#/steps/5-safety-actualisation/examples/5-1)

Within the MRS, it is important to consider the mitigation strategy to avoid failure triggers. The mitigations could take various forms such as:

- defining required design changes
- limitations to the operating concept
- deriving additional safety requirements

Specific changes to the system which will assist in the mitigation of hazardous failures is relevant for step [6.2](/#/steps/6-design-assurance/examples/6-2) therefore, in the event of a system requirement being identified, treat this as a deliverable in of itself, as part of [D16.](ref:d16)

Limitations on the operating concept may include changes to the ODM or a reclassification of the ecoego dynamics to assign certain variables to the ecosystem if it is determined that the cab cannot classify the hazard (for example, an unforseen buildup of ruffage causing a lack of adhesion.) 

On an initial runthrough of step 5-2, it is important to consider how a MRS can be achieved autonomously, within [D10](ref:d10) there is reference to limitations of a system causing a hazard, a SPAD occurs due to the disregarding of movement authority. There are many reasons to disregard movement authority, see [SPAD types](#/steps/5-safety-actualisation/examples/5.1-e) for more details, however, in a MRS, all control would be conceded to the movement authority, if possible.

Any additional safety requirements that are derived shall be added to the existing safety requirements definition [D10](ref:d10) with failure being fully explored within [the next step, 5.3](/#/steps/5-safety-actualisation/examples/5-3)

      <td>
        Adhesion reclassification is an ego-vehicle response to an ecosystem
        failure. Ultimately the ego-vehicle cannot do anything but continue
        operation and adjust to whatever changes in timetabling come,
        assuming no accident occurs from the SPAD. From a HAZOP perspective,
        adhesion reclassification should be very rare.
