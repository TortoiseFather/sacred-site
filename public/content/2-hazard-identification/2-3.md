Eco-Ego classification defines the boundaries of responsibility for a given hazard, identifying which side of the system has control or influence over each contributing factor. Ideally, we would assign as much control to the cab as possible, as we are assuming the cab to be the specific system which we have the most control over.

From [[D3]](ref:d3) we understand what hazards are present within the given environment, from [[D4]](ref:d4) we understand the basics of causation within the environment and from [[E]](ref:e) we understand the context in which hazards will be present.

Eco-Ego classification is the process of seperating the hazards identified within [[D3]](ref:d3) into components and assigning those components to either Eco or Ego.

**Example: SPAD under a bridge**

Consider a system which, after a slowdown caused by an approach to a bridge, is unable to see a signal positioned on the far side. This lack of visibility could arise for several reasons. Overgrowth of vegetation may obscure the signal, or vandalism might cause a hardware fault within the signalling logic. Both would be classified as ecosystem failures, since they result from conditions outside the cab’s direct control. Conversely, a lack of route familiarity, improper anticipation of the signal’s location, or hardware failure within the cab itself would be considered ego failures, due to the implied failure/lack of robustness when sending the system on the route for the day. 

Some causes are not so easily distinguished. Leaf accumulation, for instance, may reduce braking adhesion: a failure that originates from insufficient ecosystem maintenance but is realised through the ego-vehicle’s inability to compensate. This 'mixed hazard' as it were can be explained using James T. Reason's 'Swiss Cheese Model' of accident causation [[23]](cite:23)

To expand upon this, Figure 1 presents an abstraction of this theoretical hazard, illustrating the multiple pathways through which a Signal Passed at Danger event could occur. The diagram shows how individual failures, both ego and eco, interact and overlap. It is not exhaustive, but serves to demonstrate the principle that hazard compensation is the systematic exploration of how uncertainty in one part of the system can be counterbalanced by assurance in another.

Once hazards have been seperated, we move to step [2-4](/#/steps/2-hazard-identification/examples/2-4), to analyse how we expect a system to react to a hazard not within it's scope.
