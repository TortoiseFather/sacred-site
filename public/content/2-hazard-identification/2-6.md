**Purpose**
Step 2.6, the Identification of Components, is the step where [D1](ref:d1) is transformed from a series of qualitiative operational scenarioes into a series of verifiable states for the purpose of verifying the ODM.

**Process**

The identification of components is the process of taking the Hazards as classified within [D3](ref:d3), relating them to their specific system scope as defined within [D5](ref:d5) and mapping them as a series of states as described within the paper ['Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation.'](cite:37).

**Example**

Within [2.3](/#/steps/2-hazard-identification/examples/2-2) we identified hazards where causes are not so easily distinguished. Leaf accumulation, for instance, may reduce braking adhesion: a failure that originates from insufficient ecosystem maintenance but is realised through the ego-vehicleâ€™s inability to compensate. This 'mixed hazard' as it were can be explained using James T. Reason's 'Swiss Cheese Model' of accident causation [[23]](cite:23).

SPAD is a rather general term which is unclear, ultimately it is the ego-vehicle which SPADS, however, it is possible that the SPAD was unavoidable, given outputs from the ecosystem.

To expand upon this, Figure 1 presents an abstraction of this theoretical hazard, illustrating the multiple pathways through which a Signal Passed at Danger event could occur. The diagram shows how individual failures, both ego and eco, interact and overlap. It is not exhaustive, but serves to demonstrate the principle that hazard compensation is the systematic exploration of how uncertainty in one part of the system can be counterbalanced by assurance in another.
