**Purpose**

Environmental Risk Mapping builds upon the foundation set in Step 2.1 by shifting focus from the ego-vehicle to the environment in which it operates. Whereas Operational Feature Mapping defines what the system is and can do, Environmental Risk Mapping defines what the world contains and can do to it. In this step, the ODM and the route itself are examined in isolation to identify potential hazards, limitations, and sources of physical risk that may influence safe operation.

**Activities**

This process involves surveying the structural, environmental, and contextual aspects of the domain to capture all relevant elements that could impact autonomous behaviour. The goal is to construct a comprehensive picture of the external uncertainty landscape before any interaction with the ego-vehicle is considered.

**Output**
The outputs of steps 2.1 and 2.2 are [D3](ref:d3) and [D4](ref:d4), an example of both, using our area as defined within [1.3](/#/steps/1-concept-assurance/examples/1.3) of Swalwell Junction would be:

- SPAD

The train passes a red signal due to misinterpretation, obstruction, or delayed braking. See a full example of [D4](ref:d4) on this example in step in [2.3](/#/steps/2-hazard-identification/examples/2-3).

- Low Adhesion on Track

Build-up of wet leaves or ice reduces braking efficiency, increasing stopping distance and SPAD risk.

- Trespass

Unauthorized individuals enter track area, potentially leading to collision or emergency braking.

- Structural Degredation of Overpass

Overpass above junction deteriorates or collapses due to poor maintenance or impact.

- Signal Fault

Signal incorrectly displays or fails to communicate correct state to driver or onboard system.
