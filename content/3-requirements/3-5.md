Finally, requirement assurance is the process of taking the requirements scoped within 3.3, as they are within the ODM and ensuring that they are actually possible. Limit testing each requirement to find where it is not possible, in effect laying the groundwork for the SOC.

For example, consider 3 in [D9](ref:d9). In the event of Low Adhesion, we are to report for Railhead Treatment Trains, these are trains which run down the line and blast the track with high pressure water-jetting, however, as we designate 3 as a Ego-leaning concern, there is a possiblilty that the buildup is so severe and goes under-reported such that the reporting of the issue is a non-solution. This is of course, considered a failurestate as demonstrated within our [Milestone example](/#/steps/4-metrics/examples/4-e) where **detection of low wheel adhesion** would be a cause for an emergency break.

To this degree, we understand that 'Low Adhesion' is a possible fault, that has historical justification and we understand that there is a standard response. We also understand the limitation this puts on railway operation. As leafy buildup grows, adhesion shrinks, going into Step 4, we classify 'railway adhesion' as a limitation, regardless of the system that we build, we are going to be limited by the adhesion of the tracks, given the season.

Following this same logic was the SPAR, we understand that the limitation here is vision range; so long as the signal must be seen, there will be a limitation with the ability to see, which scales with visibility in weather (so is effected by fog.)

Now that we understand the specific requirements and their limitations, it's time to see how they change given the context of our specific route, within [Step 4.](/#/steps/4-metrics)
