To extrapolate [D1](ref:d1) into more measureable operational requirements, or 'states' as defined within the paper ['Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation.'](cite:37) Changing the vague operational scenarioes into varables.

**Example**

The requirement "When operating between Swalwell and Newcastle, the system is expected to operate during peak hours, regardless of weather, excluding extreme weather which causes a line to close." can be extrapolated into the states "Operational" and "Closed." Therefore, any state diagram describing the operation of Swalwell Junction, must include the states "operational" and "closed" with the triggering events for "closed" including "Extreme weather" and "non-peak hours."
