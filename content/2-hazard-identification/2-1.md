**Purpose**

In order to functionally identify hazards of the given scenario, it is prudent to first map out the minimum abilities of the given system for it's operational features. SACRED Step 2.1 is the process of analysing the ego-vehicle in isolation, in order to identify its operational features, functions, and dependencies.

**Activities**

This involves cataloguing the ego-vehicle’s physical and functional attributes, such as propulsion, braking, perception, communication, and decision-making capabilities, as well as the control hierarchies and input–output relationships that govern them. Each identified feature becomes a potential point of interaction with the wider ecosystem in step [2.3](/#/steps/2-hazard-identification/examples/2-3).
