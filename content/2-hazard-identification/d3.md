A structured inventory of all identified hazards within the operational environment

**Example**

The following is an incredbily abstracted example for Swalwell Junction, Newcastle Upon Tyne.

- SPAD

The train passes a red signal due to misinterpretation, obstruction, or delayed braking. 

- Low Adhesion on Track

Build-up of wet leaves or ice reduces braking efficiency, increasing stopping distance and SPAD risk.

- Trespass

Unauthorized individuals enter track area, potentially leading to collision or emergency braking.

- Structural Degredation of Overpass

Overpass above junction deteriorates or collapses due to poor maintenance or impact.

- Signal Fault

Signal incorrectly displays or fails to communicate correct state to driver or onboard system.
