**Purpose**
Step 2.6, the Identification of Components, is the step where [D1](ref:d1) is transformed from a series of qualitiative operational scenarioes into a series of verifiable states for the purpose of verifying the ODM.

**Process**

The identification of components is the process of taking the Hazards as classified within [D3](ref:d3), relating them to their specific system scope as defined within [D5](ref:d5) and mapping them as a series of states as described within the paper ['Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation.'](cite:37).
