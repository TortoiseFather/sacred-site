A verified ODM is iterative in nature as it adjusts to the level of verification that has been created.

The ODM represents the world as understood by the system. Because railways are fixed and predictable compared to roads, the ODM can be defined per route, capturing its static infrastructure (signals, junctions, gradients, overpasses, stations) and dynamic factors (other trains, pedestrians, vehicles on overpasses, environmental conditions).

The Verified ODM as created at the end of [Step 2 â€“ Hazard Identification](/#/steps/2-hazard-identification) represents a base understanding of the route as defined by [D1](ref:d1), transforming the list of operational requirements to a degree that is representitive of [D5](ref:d5). For an example of this, see [e2](ref:e2).

Throughout the SACRED methodology, the ODM is updated according to the most up-to-date data, the verified ODM by the end of [Step 4](/#/steps/4-metrics) should be a document which includes the requirements of the system, the minimum requriements to ensure assurance with the results of [F](ref:f) and [G](ref:g) and the maximum operational features of the State of the Art as analysed within [4-2](/#/steps/4-metrics/examples/4-2).
