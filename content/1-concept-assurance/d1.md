D1 is a specific list of operational scenarios defining exactly the scope of operation.

Examples:

• "When operating between Swalwell and Newcastle, the system is expected to operate during peak hours, regardless of weather, excluding extreme weather which causes a line to close."  
• "This route involves going through tunnels, meaning that the risks associated with tunnels must be considered, including risk of structural damage from tunnels and visual impairment."

D1 is not expected to be absolute and is only as good as the materials given; the rest of SACRED will iterate upon it.
As the Scenario Definition could be given (red) or a variable scoping of the environment (green) it is represented with a green/red gradient.
