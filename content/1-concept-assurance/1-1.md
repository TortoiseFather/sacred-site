**Purpose.** Establish whether the concept in [D0](ref:d0) is feasible *for this route and context*, and surface constraints/assumptions that will shape requirements and later **Step 6 (AS Design Assurance)**.

**Activities**
- Survey peer systems (metros, mainline pilots), standards (CBTC, ETCS, IEC/EN), supplier capabilities, and operator experience.
- Extract *capabilities & limits* relevant to your environment: signalling type, comms coverage, platform geometry, adhesion/low-adhesion handling, sensing ranges/occlusions, fail-safe behaviours.
- Map findings to scenarios in [D1](ref:d1) (e.g., tunnels, weather regime, peak loads).
- Record a concise **Artefact [A] SotA** (see [A](ref:a)): what exists, what’s proven, and what’s merely plausible.

**Justification**

The current State of the Art in railway automation reflects a fragmented progression, where advances in driverless metros contrast sharply with the slower evolution of mainline autonomy. While Grade of Automation 4 (GoA-4) systems operate successfully in closed environments such as the Copenhagen Metro, their success depends on tightly controlled infrastructure, segregated tracks, and deterministic signalling. Translating these capabilities to open mainline operation has proved far more complex. Unlike metros, mainline networks must contend with variable adhesion, shared infrastructure, mixed traffic, and human-in-the-loop interactions that limit the applicability of fully deterministic control. To this end, determining the exact scope of your system as well as any contemporaries is essential for the purposes of ODM creation.

**Evidence.** 

Paris Métro Line 1 (GoA-4) demonstrates driverless operation feasibility in segregated infrastructure. 

**Implication:** comparable autonomy on open mainline will need additional mitigations (trespass, weather variability, complex interlockings).

One State of the Art computer vision technique is the You Only Look Once (YOLO[53](cite:53)) detection system. YOLO has been applied to rail through experiments on the [Roboflow](cite:54) platform, to mixed results[55](cite:55). The company Railvision[rv](cite:railvision) suggests that 2km of continuous vision is required for CV operation, through our own experimentation, we are aware of software such as DIST-YOLO[56](cite:56) which attempts to scope YOLO functionality regarding distance from camera, however, DIST-YOLO does not claim to work past 150m. 

**Implication** regarding SotA-exploration for [step 6](/#/steps/6-design-assurance) the usage of CV will be complicated, for the purposes of our exploration, CV usage will remain purely hypothetical, simply due to the large amount of data and data processing required to implement true SotA railway CV on par with that which occurs within, for example, automotive.
