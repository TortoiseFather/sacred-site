Artefact C is the initial Safe Operating Context (SOC).

It is given or derived from Deliverable D2 and describes the context in which current railway systems operate, for example:

• Speed limits  
• Signal limits  
• Signal visibility lengths  

It anchors later safety analysis by bounding where the system is expected to operate safely.
