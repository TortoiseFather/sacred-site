One perspective we hold throughout the SACRED methodology is that of rail being 'an Ego-vehicle within an ecosystem.' To explain this perspective, we must first explain the concepts of the Ego-Vehicle and the Ecosystem.

From a fundamental perspective, ego-thought is the concept that a system need only concern itself with it's immediate surroundings. A car does not need consider the speed limits of a road it does not intend to drive on, it does not necessarily need to concern itself with any car on the road that is not within it's immediate vacinity. 

In practical terms, the autonomous train cab must be viewed as an ego-vehicle: it retains the ultimate decision-making autonomy regarding actions such as speed adjustments, braking decisions, and responses to immediate hazards. Major railway innovation is currently rooted in the idea that the cab is an 'ego-vehicle' for example, Mainline breaking and horn performance metrics by [Rustam Tagiew](cite:33) exists under the assumption that a train is responsible for it's own operation and must detect objects from a head-mounted perspective, likewise the paper "Towards a Specified Operational Design Domain for a Safe Remote Driving of Trains" by [Abhimanyu Tonk et al](cite:34) argues that any remote driving system must *"compromise the sensor devices and controller components embedded within the motorized vehicle, such as cameras, sonar sensors, etc."* Ultimately suggesting that the system is responsible for itself, i.e is an ego-vehicle.

However, rail does not exist within a vaccum. Signalling systems, track management, infrastructure and remote operating centers all play a vital role in the operation of a railway system. Where a car reacts to a traffic light as it comes into it's vision, a train is aware of a signal miles before it learns of it's state.

While the specific layout of the 'Railway ecosystem' is not agreed upon, [with different authorities having different classifications of just what classifies as part of the system of systems.](cite:8) In the paper 'Maintaining Railway Safety in an Ever-Changing World' [Peter Sheppard and Ross Dunsford](cite:35) write *"The UK railway industry operates to the two principles of: 1. any new system must be safer than that currently in use; and, 2. the risk is to be reduced so far as is reasonably practicable. Whilst appearing very simple and straightforward, applying these two principles reveals a greater number of problems. A railway is a system of systems, changing one part may have emergent properties on another part. that part may be mechanical, electrical, software or human, and the humans include not only the railway staff, but also the passengers and other members of the public."*

To this end, an interesting dichotomy emerges. When considering the cab, we must treat the system as an ego-vehicle as we only have direct control over the ego-area. However, railway is ultimately an ecosystem of interconnected parts, the cab gets it's information from the surrouning ecosystem. With a philosophy of trust but verify, we understand that the ecosystem can make mistakes. The cab is subject to external oversight yet must retain sufficient autonomy to safely override external signals when necessary, for instance, if encountering unanticipated hazards on the track.

We therefore make the argument that railway is an Ego-vehicle within an Ecosystem. The cab's autonomy is neither absolute nor negligible. Effective deployment of autonomous technology in rail requires balancing the independent decision-making capabilities of individual vehicles against the interdependent operational realities dictated by safety, efficiency, and network capacity.

[Sangiorgio](cite:36) argues that the ego must take over given a failing of the ecosystem, [Tagiew](cite:33) argues that the mainline breaking and honking metrics are important within the immediate term of emergency breaking, [Uzuka](cite:11) presents the system of systems so that the cab in of itself has it's own separate topology, the EU Systems Pillar paradigm suggests that the cab is a layer in of itself. There is already an understanding that a locomotive is an ego-vehicle within an ecosystem and within SACRED we take this understanding as fact.
