Deliverable D2 is the MoSCoW structure, which determines the scope of operation.
It compares the wishes defined within D0 to the state of the art and identifies what is specifically required.

It provides a structured way to capture requirements as Must/Should/Could/Would and is refined in later SACRED steps.
As a standalone document produced by the SACRED methodology, we represent the MoSCoW structure as purple.
