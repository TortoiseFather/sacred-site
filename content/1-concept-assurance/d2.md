Deliverable D2 is the MoSCoW structure, which determines the scope of operation.
It compares the wishes defined within D0 to the state of the art and identifies what is specifically required.

It provides a structured way to capture requirements as Must/Should/Could/Won't and is refined in later SACRED steps.
