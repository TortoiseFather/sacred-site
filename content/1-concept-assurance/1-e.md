A central point of confusion throughout safety research is the classification of the environment. It is generally agreed that in order to operate within a given environment, a system must in some way understand the environment.

Of course, any system will operate with some level of [uncertainty](/#/steps/2-hazard-identification/examples/2-e) as exhaustive classification of an envrionment requires a level of fidelity which would be considered out of scope for a given autonomous system, especially in autonomous rail where data is particularly difficult to acquire [[27].](cite:27)

To this end, the degree in which a given environment is understood is traditionally understood within the scope of an Operational Design Domain (ODD). An ODD is classified as *'A set of capabilities and limitations for a set of pre-defined operating conditions of a given Autonomous System'* [[28.]](cite:28) To summarize, the ODD refers to the conditions under which an autonomous system is intended to function: weather, infrastrucutre, behavioural constraints, ect. To this end, an ODD is to be considered a deliverable in of itself; a list of conditions in which an autonomous system can exist.

One of the risks in current ODD practice, as highlighted by [Shakeri (2024),](cite:29) is the tendency to treat the ODD taxonomy as if it were a complete representation of the operational domain itself. This can result in a sort of 'protective shell' effect, where the boundaries of safe operation are treated as rigid, and anything outside them is assumed to be either irrelevant or out of scope. This framing, while useful for delimiting system responsibility or avoiding [state explosion](cite:stateexplosion), can become counterproductive when it encourages systems that cannot function safely when the world deviates even slightly from the modelled domain.

Shakeri’s formalisation clarifies that an ODD is a subset of a well-defined OD, or in our case, a OD which is modelled. When the OD is left vague the taxonomy that’s meant to describe system-environment interaction loses semantic grounding. It becomes a list of conditions without a model of where those conditions come from, or how they interact. This distinction is particularly important in the context of rail. Unlike road-based systems, where the operational domain may be fluid and subject to rapid contextual change, the railway environment is highly structured. A train operates exclusively on a predefined track, and its movement is governed by centrally coordinated systems that monitor traffic, infrastructure health, signalling, and environmental risks, defined collectively as an [ecosystem.](/#/steps/1-concept-assurance/examples/1.1-e)

Regardless of the fact the ODD is considered standard within autonomy, we opt instead to follow a different paradigm. Thankfully, the nice thing about standards is there's so many to choose from. The Operational Domain Model (ODM) is a design standard proposed by [Osborne et al](cite:31) which describes *“Elements with which any AS may be required to safely interact with while completing its tasks.”* So, while the ODD defines how the system can interact with the environment, extracting the series of requirements that the system can achieve, the ODM scopes the environment which the system exists within and extracts the minimum set of requirements the system must achieve.

Within the context of rail where the domain is set in advance, compared to the much more flexible domain of the roadways, the ODM seems a more apt choice for requirement capturing. After all, if a train somehow gets 'out of domain' then it is safe to suggest that you have a bigger problem on your hands.
