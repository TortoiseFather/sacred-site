The combination of [D11](ref:d11) and [D12](ref:d12) as they pertain to the context within [D7](ref:d7)

**Example**

The train is coming from a junction. We know from [D11](ref:d11) that due to derailment risks in sharp turning, our system must slow down to 30mph during a junction, so our maximum speed is 30mph, within [D12](ref:d12) we know the line speed limit of this are is also 30mph, so we are within that, we also know that the next signal after the junction is still not within vision, being as it is after the bridge. However, we know from [D7](ref:d7) that the signal is >200m after the bridge, so in order to stay within our SVB as identified in [D11](ref:d11), we need to keep our driving speed less than 56mph.

Viewing distance is another example of a System-specific metric, one which typically scales with light level, which would result in a range, for example, a typical mobile phone camera may have a maximum viewing distance of 200m at standstill, in lab conditions, however, as distance increases, quality decreases, meaning that the image may be unsuitable for computer vision purposes after a certain distance, however, what exactly this threshold is remains to be seen and is determined within [Step 6](/#/steps/6-design-assurance). Fundamentally, the 'lab conditions' are also unlikely to calibrtate with the context of [D12](ref:d12) as viewing distance is agnostic of geography, whether the train operates near Newcastle, York, or London has great impact on the real viewing distance of a system.
