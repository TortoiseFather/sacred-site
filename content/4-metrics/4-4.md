Safety in rail is context dependent, the difference between a Signal Passed At Danger (SPAD) and a Signal Passed At Red (SPAR) is somewhat arbitrary without knowing the end-result, to this end, the passing of the signal is the failure point but not the critical incident. Multiple thresholds must have been broken for a SPAR to occur and if the SPAR becomes a SPAD is unknown until it happens.

Context Calibration ensures that every metric derived in Step 4 reflects the true operating conditions of the route as described within the ODM, determining how likely a given metric is to fail and how severe the consequences are. This process mirrors the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) approach used in conventional safety engineering, where parameters are systematically evaluated for deviation, frequency, and impact.

**Method/Examples**

- Contextual Alignment

[D11](ref:d11) and [D12](ref:d12) are contextualised against [D7](ref:d7), producing [D13](ref:d13). 

For example, the train is coming from a junction. We know from [D11](ref:d11) that due to derailment risks in sharp turning, our system must slow down to 30mph during a junction, so our maximum speed is 30mph, within [D12](ref:d12) we know the line speed limit of this are is also 30mph, so we are within that, we also know that the next signal after the junction is still not within vision, being as it is after the bridge. However, we know from [D7](ref:d7) that the signal is >200m after the bridge, so in order to stay within our SVB as identified in [D11](ref:d11), we need to keep our driving speed less than 26m/s, or 56mph.

Viewing distance is another example of a System-specific metric, one which typically scales with light level, which would result in a range, for example, a typical mobile phone camera may have a maximum viewing distance of 200m at standstill, in lab conditions, however, as distance increases, quality decreases, meaning that the image may be unsuitable for computer vision purposes after a certain distance, however, what exactly this threshold is remains to be seen and is determined within [Step 6](/#/steps/6-design-assurance). Fundamentally, the 'lab conditions' are also unlikely to calibrtate with the context of [D12](ref:d12) as viewing distance is agnostic of geography, whether the train operates near Newcastle, York, or London has great impact on the real viewing distance of a system.

- Failure Point Identification

From this contextualised example, we can draw several failure points and from [D6](ref:d6) we can understand why they may occur. 

Immediately, it is possible that our system does not know the location of the signal, this would be from a insufficiently detailed [D7](ref:d7) from a *hardware failure*. The signal could not be in its correct place, due to a *structural failure*, we could be speeding before, during or after the junction *current speed>speed limit*, we could have miscalculated the SVB, leading to an event where *T>SVB*

- Criticality Determination

Take the failure points identified and classify them by their severity, resulting in [D14](ref:d14). Severity is classified by the [Top Level Hazard Analysis table](/#/steps/4-metrics/examples/4.1-e)

Example, *current speed>speed limit* on a junction results in a high risk of derailment, top priority hazard in this scenario.

*Hardware failure* in this example results in a missed signal, due to the proximity to an urban hub and a railway station, hardware failure here is likely to cause incident, second order priority haards in this scenario.

*T>SVB* has a wide range of failure in this situation, in the event that the signal is green, continue as normal, no hazard, the SPAD is a SPAR

*Structural failure* assuming all else is static, the system is aware that a signal should be in this location, so can assume the worst and proceed at caution, with the proximity to a station, a minimum approach strategy, reducing speed so that stopping distance>viewing distance and hazards can be analysed in real time, this has a risk of passenger discomfort. Assuming no hardware failure is also present, manual operation can be described within the diagram below.

- Criticality Classification

Classify each failure point by likelihood and frequency, with frequency being gathered from [F](ref:f) and [G](ref:g) then include the results from [D14](ref:d14) to create a HAZOP [D15](ref:d15)
