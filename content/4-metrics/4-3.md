While Step 4.2 defines system-specific metrics that describe how the autonomous system behaves, Step 4.3 introduces the complementary layer of environmental metrics.

These metrics describe the minimum operational scope of the environment itself, translating the qualitative description of the route into quantifiable environmental boundaries that directly constrain the systemâ€™s behaviour.

**Method**

- Extract Environmental Descitors from the ODM

Begin with the descriptive elements of the environment already identified during Step 1/2. These include geography, topology, infrastructure, and environmental phenomena.

- Translate Descriptors into Quantifiable Metrics

Each qualitative descriptor is converted into a measurable parameter. For example, rather than 'There is a bridge which limits visibility and then a signal shortly after' quantify it as 'Signal >200 meters past bridge.'

[Then, continue on to calibrate the Ego-Metrics with the Eco-Metrics to create Unified Metrics.](/#/steps/4-metrics/examples/4-4)
