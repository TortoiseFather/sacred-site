Route-Specific Metrics are the minimum scope of the environment, similar to the [Context of Safe Operation](/#/steps/1-concept-assurance/examples/1.3-e), the minimum scope of the environment is a somewhat more specified [ODM](/#/steps/1-concept-assurance/examples/1-e) which considers the fact that the route will have a system operating within it.

Route-Specific Metrics could be considered synonymous with 'Eco-Metrics.' 

**Example**

For example, within the bounds of an ODM, we would argue the area of Swalwell to Metrocentre to be

*"An urban area close to a population centre with dense but maintained fauna, an overpass which is used regularly by commuters and fencing seperating railway track from the publically accessible footpaths. The railway track has a series of signals, one shortly after the overpass."*

That alone is not very actionable, furthermore it does not tell us how to classify the safety of a system within the environment, but the information can be extrapolated into a series of Route-specific metrics, such as:

**Route speed limits**
Both the legal speed limit and the signal transmission limit for a given section of track.

**Route signal visibility**
The distance at which a signal comes into visibility, given the circumstances.

**Fauna maintenence score**
The level at which fauna obstructs vision.
