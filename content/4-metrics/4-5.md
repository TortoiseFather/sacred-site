Here is a decision point in which we determine if the current ODM is mature enough to progress, or if further refinement is required.

Up to this point, Steps 4.1â€“4.4 have transformed validated hazards into measurable, context-calibrated metrics, identifying where failures could occur and embedding those conditions within the ODM. However, it is possible that metrics have been determined which cannot be contextualised within the existing ODM. If that is the case, return to [Step 2](/#/steps/2-hazard-identification)

If not, proceed to [Step 5](/#/steps/5-safety-actualisation)
