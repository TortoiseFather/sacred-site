Step 4.1 represents the transition from qualitative assurance to quantitative verification.

In Step 3, hazards were validated and captured as verifiable requirements in the form of an updated MoSCoW structure, step 4 is the process of transforming those requirements into metrics which can be evaluated, simulated, or, observed within the ODM. 

This process gives structure to the phrase “metrics that matter.” It provides the foundation for later calibration (Step 4.4) and criticality analysis by ensuring that every safety or performance requirement has an associated mathematical or observable form.

**Method**

- Extract Requirements

Draw directly from the outputs of Step 3, [D9](ref:d9) and [D10](ref:d10).

- Identify Measurable Variables

For each requirement, determine what variables express its fulfilment or violation.

- Define Mathematical or Logical Expressions

Where relevant, translate the variable into an equation, rule, or measurable constraint.
