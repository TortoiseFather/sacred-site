The paper ['Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation'](cite:37) defines milestones within the context of automation. An environment can be represented as a series of states, with each state having a different mode of operation.

For example, consider this abstracted and simplified state machine for railway operation:

During standard operation, considering no anomalous external factors, a train is in 'cruise' a state which maintains speed and standard operation. In order to leave 'cruise' one of three things must happen, the first, is a standard exit of cruise, when the train approaches a point on it's journey where the **speed limit changes** then it would need to either speed up, or slow down. Within this example, **speed limit change** is the milestone that causes a transition [towards the state of speed change or brake change.](cite:MilestoneNote)

The second is a verified exit of cruise, at random intervals throughout transit, the **AWS Alarm** will sound, regardless of state of operation, the **AWS Alarm** takes priority, requiring whatever is operating the train to respond immediately, meaning there always must be a direct transition from any given state to AWS.

The third is an emergency exit of cruise, this can be triggered by any number of reasons, but sticking with the theme established within [D9](ref:d9) a **detection of low wheel adhesion** would be a cause for an emergency break, meaning the transition between cruise and E-break.
