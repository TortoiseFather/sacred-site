Hazards from [D13] as they relate to the [Top Level Hazard Analysis.](/#/steps/4-metrics/examples/4.1-e)

**Example**

*current speed>speed limit* on a junction results in a high risk of derailment, top priority hazard in this scenario.

*Hardware failure* in this example results in a missed signal, due to the proximity to an urban hub and a railway station, hardware failure here is likely to cause incident, second order priority haards in this scenario.

*T>SVB* has a wide range of failure in this situation, in the event that the signal is green, continue as normal, no hazard, the SPAD is a SPAR

*Structural failure* assuming all else is static, the system is aware that a signal should be in this location, so can assume the worst and proceed at caution, with the proximity to a station, a minimum approach strategy, reducing speed so that stopping distance>viewing distance and hazards can be analysed in real time, this has a risk of passenger discomfort. Assuming no hardware failure is also present, manual operation can be described within the diagram below.
