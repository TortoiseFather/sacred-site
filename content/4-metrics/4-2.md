The definition of metrics that are agnostic of route or location and represent the core performance boundaries of the ego-vehicle. This is similar to that of an Operational Design Domain (ODD) only much more restricted.

Safety attributes only acquire meaning when contextualised in time and space, yet before such contextualisation can occur, a baseline set of system-agnostic metrics must be defined to represent the invariant limits of safe operation. the Operational Metrics remain true regardless of where the train is operating.

**Example**

A camera which works in a light level >5 lux, will remain true regardless of environment, however, if [D12](ref:d12) shows an environment which has a required light level <5 lux, this specific system is then excluded within [D13](ref:d13).

Viewing distance is another example of a System-specific metric, a typical mobile phone camera may have a maximum viewing distance of 200m at standstill, in lab conditions. This maximum remains true regardless of situation.
