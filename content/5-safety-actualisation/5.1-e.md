Not all SPADs represent a violation of rules or a systemic failure; rather, certain SPAD occurrences can be classified as authorised, unavoidable, or even optional under specific operational contexts. Understanding the distinction between these scenarios is critical to accurately assessing railway safety metrics.

Authorised SPADs occur under predefined conditions and with explicit permission from signalling personnel. As outlined in Module S5 of the UK Railway Rule Book [57](cite:57), such movements may be permitted in scenarios including signal failures, controlled shunting, emergency recoveries, or degraded-mode operations. These events involve stringent safety procedures: the driver and signaller must verify the route ahead, ensure level crossings are secured, and conduct movement at reduced speed to minimise risk. Notably, these SPADs are not inherently risk-free. For instance, in the Redcar level crossing incident (RAIB Report R052025) [58](cite:58), a signal was passed with authorisation due to suspected equipment failure, but the signaller neglected to close the level crossing — resulting in a collision. Although authorisation originates with the signal operator, it is often initiated at the driver’s request.

In extreme emergencies as defined in later revisions of Module S5 [59](cite:59) a driver may pass a red signal without contact. In this work, we refer to such scenarios as Unauthorised Authorised SPADs (UASPADs), though to date no publicly documented cases have confirmed this practice beyond anecdotal evidence.

Unavoidable SPADs refer to instances where a train passes a red signal despite the operator following correct procedures. These typically result from extreme environmental or infrastructure conditions, such as poor adhesion from leaf residue, unexpected signal faults, or low-visibility events. The Stonegate incident [60](cite:60) exemplifies this: wet leaves and insufficient sand in the hopper prevented effective braking, making the SPAD inevitable despite proper driver response.

Confusingly, although the driver handbook and most official documentation discusses SPADs in this form, government-produced reports (gathered through a freedom-of-information request) classify SPADs based on *Risk Ranking*, as shown within Figure \ref{fig:SPADChart}. SPAD risk rating justification can be found within the ORR's *Quality and Methodology Report* [61](cite:61) as well as the Rail Safety statistics portal [62](cite:62). Unfortunately, the specific metrics behind SPAD Risk Ranking scoring are more difficult to obtain, so it is not clear at this point what differentiates a “no significant risk” SPAD from a “potentially severe” SPAD. Using historical publications, we may estimate the current system; however, this cannot be said to represent 2025 practices with confidence.
