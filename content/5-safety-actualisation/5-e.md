When considering the management of failure within autonomous railway systems, the TRAP paradigm defines how hazards are detected, classified, and procedurally managed when normal operation can no longer be assured. While earlier stages of SACRED (Steps 1–4) aim to predict and pre-empt uncertainty, TRAP begins where prediction fails.

The acronym TRAP stands for Trigger, Response, Assurance, and Process. 

- **Trigger** is any event or condition that indicates a deviation from [D11](ref:d11) the defined Context of Safe Operation CSO. An example of this could be a signal showing danger while the train’s braking margin is insufficient, or a misclassification of a lineside object. 

- **Response** immediate, rule-based actions designed to stabilise the situation. Deciding the level of response, from local recovery (adjusting braking curves, requesting clarification from signalling) to systemic intervention (bringing the train to a halt, contacting control). 

- **Assurance** follows, Defining the safe degraded mode of operation. For a train, this may mean defaulting to the most restrictive assumption: stop-and-proceed, emergency brake, or holding position until ecosystem confirmation is received.

- **Process** The enactment of the fallback plan as a procedural routine. Rehearsed, much like emergency drills in human railway operations.

TRAP assumes that despite robust metrics and verification, failure states will occur, and therefore they must be anticipated and rehearsed. Derived from established decision cycles such as [Boyd’s OODA loop (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act)](cite:25), T.Anderson's ['How To: Fault Tolerance'](cite:26) and SACE’s SUDA model [(Sense–Understand–Decide–Act)](cite:30), TRAP is a streamlined structure specifically adapted for railway immediacy.

**Example: SVB Failure**

Failure does happen, as part of the Swiss Cheese model of safety, we understand that in exceptional circumstances, small errors can snowball; within step 4, we argue that the SPAD rate for Swalwell-Ncl is trivial due to the low likelihood of misclassification and there being no historical precedent for SPAD in the area. However, this likelihood is not zero. To this end, we demonstrate the TRAP paradigm on a worked example.

- Trigger
T>SVB OR Signal shows “Danger” (red) and train has insufficient track length to stop, OR misclassification of signal detected (e.g., contradictory inputs between cab signalling and trackside, valdalism, signal is unreadable).
- Response
Initiate emergency braking. If authorised procedures apply (e.g., signaller permission, degraded mode), proceed at “stop-and-proceed” speed.
- Assurance
UK Rail Rule Book S5 procedures. Validated stopping curves under varying adhesion classes. Logged justification (human-equivalent “explainability”).
- Process
Apply brakes according to emergency profile. The event must be logged with sufficient contextual data (adhesion, sighting, braking input) to allow post-incident analysis and assurance. Escalate to ecosystem (signaller) for ongoing management.

We see within this initial TRAP, there are several inadequacies of detail; it is not clear what exactly must be logged within the process, it is not clear exactly how justification is to be recorded, and the scenario is still abstract to the point we are not sure how ‘involved’ the cab will be. This is an intended result of the iterative process of steps 5 and 6. Step 5 deliberately surfaces these gaps. By exposing where our procedures lack clarity, TRAP provides the scaffolding for Step 6, where state-of-the-art technologies are introduced to close the loop.
