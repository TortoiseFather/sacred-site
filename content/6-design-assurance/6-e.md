The OpenBVE project[51](cite:51) is a ferroequinologist specialty software which began development in 2001, and is still actively maintained. This open-source simulator allows users to operate various user-created trains, often modeled with high fidelity to real-world locomotive specifications, on equally realistic, user-generated routes. OpenBVE prioritizes realism over user-friendliness, offering detailed route timing, an advanced physics engine, and precise train control and cab environments. Its design philosophy, as stated by the developers, emphasizes “realism, not necessarily user-friendliness” compared to other simulators in its genre, especially commercial alternatives[51](cite:51).  While OpenBVE has yet to see widespread academic application, this is likely a result of its niche audience rather than limitations in its academic utility.

For our purposes, we have modified OpenBVE in a way that makes it a suitable agent for supervision learning[51](cite:52), this was the simulator used for our milestone determination paper[37](cite:37).

A full exploration of our modifications to OpenBVE is shown within the following document:
